## "Hyperleukocytosis" versus "Leukostasis"**Hyperleukocytosis** - having a leukemic WBC count greater than 50-100k/mL**Leukostasis** - a medical emergency in which a patient with hyperleukocytosis is having end organ effects from the WBC's "plugging" the microvasculature, especially in the CNS and lungs. End organ effects are attributed to both poor perfusion and the local hypoxemia from the highly metabolically active blasts and cytokine release.The symptoms of leukostasis not only depend on the amount of WBC's but also how large and poorly deformable the blast cells are (which AML notoriously has large sticky cells)In terms of leukemias, ALL is more likely to have hyperleukocytosis but less likely leukostasis compared to AML. ALL is more likely to give you Tumor lysis syndrome.Blood transfusions and diuretics can both worsen leukostasis by increasing blood viscosity.## ClinicalPatients can have dyspnea, hypoxia, and interstitial or alveolar infiltrates on imaging.Neurologic signs can mimic stroke.Most patients are febrile. Often associated with DICRisk of intracranial hemorrhage - The risk is greatest after the WBC count has been markedly reduced, suggesting that a reperfusion injury may occur when the circulation is restored to previously hypoxemic or ischemic capillary bedsMeasurement of the PaO2 may be falsely decreased in patients with hyperleukocytosis as the WBCs in the test tube use up some of the oxygen. It is better to rely on the SpO2 pulse oximetry to guage oxygenation status.Similarly, automated platelet counts can be falsely elevated because the machine is counting blast fragments as plateletsBe cautious about getting a contrast imaging study this type of patient who it already at high kidney injury risk due to TLS, dehydration, and leukostasis.## Management1. Chemotherapy - rapidly reduce the burden of leukemic cells while monitoring/prophylaxing for tumor lysis syndrome* If the patient isn't able to start immediate chemotherapy (renal insufficiency, severe metabolic derangements, etc.) can start cytoreducation with hydroxyurea* Can also do pheresis to remove the WBC's but this doesn't kill the leukemic cells in the bone marrow like chemotherapy2. Adequate fluid resuscitation and ongoing replacement > maintenance rate3. Monitor respiratory function, CNS exam, and renal function
